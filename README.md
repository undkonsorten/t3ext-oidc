# OpenID Connect

This extension lets you authenticate Frontend users against an OpenID Connect
server. It is preconfigured to work with the
[WSO2 Identity Server](https://wso2.com/identity-and-access-management/) from
the Swiss Alpine Club but may be used with your own identity server as well.

If you are a Swiss Alpine Club section, be sure to get in touch with Bern in
order to get your dedicated private key and secret.


## Default FE Loginbox

This extension integrates with the system extension 'felogin'.

This Fluid markup can be used to include a link to the authorization endpoint of
the authorization server.

```html
<f:if condition="{openidConnectUri}">
    <f:then>
        <a href="{openidConnectUri}" class="btn btn-default"><span class="fa fa-openid"></span> OpenID Connect</a>
    </f:then>
    <f:else>
        Invalid OpenID Connect configuration
    </f:else>
</f:if>
```

See also `Resources/Private/Templates/Login/Login.html` as reference.

## OIDC Login

If openid_connect is your only means of frontend login, you can use the included
"OIDC Login" plugin. Add it to your login page, where you would normally add the
felogin box. After adding the OIDC Login plugin, requests to the login page will
immediately be redirected to the authorization server.

After the login process, the user will be redirected:

- The OIDC Login supports the same `redirect_url` parameter as the felogin box
- If no parameter is set, OIDC Login will redirect the user to the page
  configured at `plugin.tx_oidc_login.defaultRedirectPid`.
- If that configuration is not set either, the user will be redirected to '/'.

## PKCE (Proof of Key for Code Exchange)

If your OIDC Login supports _Proof of Key for Code Exchange_ you can enable it
by checking `enableCodeVerifier` in the extension configuration. A shared secret
will be sent along preventing _Authorization Code Interception Attacks_. See
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636 for details.

## Configuring

### Mapping Frontend User Fields

- Configuration is done through TypoScript within
  `plugin.tx_oidc.mapping.fe_users`
- OIDC attributes will be recognized by the specific characters `<>`:

  ```
  email = <mail>
  ```

- You may combine multiple markers as well, e.g.,

  ```
  name = <family_name>, <given_name>
  ```

- Support for [stdWrap](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/master/en-us/Functions/Stdwrap.html) in
  field definition, e.g.,

  ```
  name = <name>
  name.wrap = |-OIDC
  ```

- Support for [TypoScript "split"](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/master/en-us/Functions/Stdwrap.html#data)
  (`//`). This will check multiple field names and return the first one yielding
  some non-empty value. E.g.,

  ```
  username = <sub> // <contact_number> // <emailaddress> // <benutzername>
  ```

### Mapping Frontend User Groups

- Create your groups within TYPO3
- Use the additional pattern to relate it to roles within OpenID Connect
- Local TYPO3 groups (not related to some role) will be kept upon authenticating
- Default TYPO3 group(s) as configured in Extension Manager will always be added

### OIDC Login

- `plugin.tx_oidc_login.defaultRedirectPid` UID of the page that users will be
  redirected to, if no `redirect_url` parameter is set.

## Logging

This extension makes use of the Logging system introduced in TYPO3 CMS 6.0. It
is far more flexible than the old one writing to the "sys_log" table. Technical
details may be found in the [TYPO3 Core API](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/master/en-us/ApiOverview/Logging/Index.html#logging).

As an administrator, what you should know is that the TYPO3 Logger forwards log
records to "Writers", which persist the log record.

By default, with a vanilla TYPO3 installation, messages are written to the
default log file (`var/log/typo3_*.log`).


### Dedicated Log File for OpenID Connect

If you want to redirect every logging information from this extension to
`var/log/oidc.log` and send log entries with level "WARNING" or above to the
system log, you may add following configuration to
`typo3conf/AdditionalConfiguration.php`:

```
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['LOG']['Causal']['Oidc']['writerConfiguration'] = [
    \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Log\LogLevel::DEBUG => [
        \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Log\Writer\FileWriter::class => [
            'logFileInfix' => 'oidc'
        ],
    ],

    // Configuration for WARNING severity, including all
    // levels with higher severity (ERROR, CRITICAL, EMERGENCY)
    \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Log\LogLevel::WARNING => [
        \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Log\Writer\SyslogWriter::class => [],
    ],
];
```

**Hint:** Be sure to read
[Configuration of the Logging system](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/master/en-us/ApiOverview/Logging/Configuration/Index.html#logging-configuration)
to fine-tune your configuration on any production website.
